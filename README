# This is a proof of concept python script using the Twilio API to enable control of hardware or software devices via  #
# SMS messages.                                                                                                        #
#                                                                                                                      #
# The goal of this was to control hardware easily through SMS which was done by triggering scripts written             #
# in the arduino IDE on an Intel Edison. In the future I would like to flesh this project out and start moving towards #
# home automation. I also plan on moving away from SSH and towards scripts fetching SMS commands via databases.        #
#                                                                                                                      #
# SSH was only used as a proof of concept, it is a horrible idea to use it in this manner due to security. It was only #
# used because of the lack of time and the amount of time spent on Edison debugging.                                   #

# A python script sets up a flask server which constantly listens for incoming commands. The Twilio API and services   #
# send these commands via POST when a text is relieved or sent, the incoming post is sent from the flask server        #
# and processed through this python script which sends back POST to the api, along with commands to the intel Edison,  #
# or whatever device you are connecting to.                                                                            #

UPDATE: NGROK has stopped forwarding my post from the API through the ngrok tunnel unabling me to use this w/o port
	forwarding or buying a domain. I will att  attatch the API logs to show that it does work and I will also 
	include screenshots of the SMS on my phone. Not really sure how to show commands being executed on the Edison
	but I can show the files created and ran and my test scripts if need be.
