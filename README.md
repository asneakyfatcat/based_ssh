Side Note: This was my first hackathon, and besides having python experience I had 0 experience, or had even heard of the library's, hardware, and API's used. It was one hell of a crash course / learning experience

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ | | | DEPENDENCIES: Twilio Python API (twilio.twiml), Paramiko python Library, Flask python library, Ngrok | | --all python libraries are availible through PIP for easy install-- | | | ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ | | | This is a proof of concept python script using the Twilio API to enable control of hardware or software devices via | | SMS messages. | | | | The goal of this was to control hardware easily through SMS which was done by triggering scripts written | | in the arduino IDE on an Intel Edison. In the future I would like to flesh this project out and start moving towards | | home automation. I also plan on moving away from SSH and towards scripts fetching SMS commands via databases. | | | | SSH was only used as a proof of concept, it is a horrible idea to use it in this manner due to security. It was only | | used because of the lack of time and the amount of time spent on Edison debugging. | | | ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ | |
| SO HOW DOES IT WORK!?!?!? | | | | A python script sets up a flask server which constantly listens for incoming commands. The Twilio API and services | | send these commands via POST when a text is relieved or sent, the incoming post is sent from the flask server | | and processed through this python script which sends back POST to the api, along with commands to the intel Edison,| | or whatever device you are connecting to. | | | | Side note: I also used the program ngrok for easy tunneling for the flask server. | | | +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ | | | Where to go now!? | | | | -switch from SSH to database fetching for security and ease of use | | | | -Add more commands and ease of use | | -Focus more on hardware | | -add comments explaining what the hell is going on | | -clean up code | | -splash screen when connecting for the first time | | -!?!?!?!??!!? | | -profit | | |

UPDATE: NGROK has stopped forwarding my post from the API through the ngrok tunnel unabling me to use this w/o port forwarding or buying a domain. I will attatch the API logs to show that it does work and I will also include screenshots of the SMS on my phone. Not really sure how to show commands being executed on the Edison but I can show the files created and ran and my test scripts if need be.

Also the edison is a nightmare. Built in bug after bug in the default distro dealing with hardware on the breakout board. I can't even SSH into it anymore even after factory reset, and the error logs are a mystery. There is very little documentation on this device.
